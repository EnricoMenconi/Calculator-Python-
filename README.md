# Advanced Calculator

Welcome to my advanced calculator project! I call it advanced because, in addition to basic operations, it also calculates square roots and exponentiations.

## Features
- Performs operations with real numbers;
- User-friendly;
- Some humor in the Code, intended to make your experience light and fun while reflecting my personality. I thought it would be a good idea to use a calculator as a way to introduce myself, as I believe programming can be both functional and enjoyable. I hope to bring a few smiles while you check out my work! What's wrong with that, right?

## Usage
- 1: Run the script in your Python environment and follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
- 2: Don't forget to smile!

Thank you for checking out my project!
